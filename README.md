# IcyTower

> This is a platform game set in a tower, where the player's goal is to jump from one "floor" to the next and go as high as possible without falling. The higher the player's character climbs, the faster the tower's floors move downward and the harder the game becomes. By default, the player controls the character using a keyboard.
